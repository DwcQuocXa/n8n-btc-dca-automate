**Original**: €26,249 (150.9% | 37.9% CAGR)  
**Optimized**: €30,980 (178.0% | 43.0% CAGR)  
**Improvement**: +€4,731 (+27.2%)

**Analysis**: SOL demonstrated the most significant benefit from trend-aware profit taking. The optimization prevented premature selling during SOL's explosive growth periods, particularly during the 2023-2024 bull runs. The strategy maintained higher SOL allocation (67.8% avg vs 66.5% original) while reducing sell trades.

**Market Regime Impact**: 190 bull market days (18.2%) where the optimization prevented selling

### 2. Bitcoin (BTC) - Strong Optimization Gains  
**Original**: €18,320 (105.3% | 28.6% CAGR)  
**Optimized**: €21,919 (126.0% | 33.0% CAGR)  
**Improvement**: +€3,600 (+20.7%)

**Analysis**: BTC showed substantial improvement through trend filtering. The optimization successfully identified and held through major BTC bull runs, particularly the 2024 institutional adoption phase. Average BTC allocation increased from 66.9% to 69.6%.
