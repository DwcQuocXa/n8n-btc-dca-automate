# CORRECTED Complete Crypto DCA Strategy Analysis Report  
## 3-Year Historical Backtest - Proper n8n Workflow Implementation (2022-2025)

### üö® CRITICAL CORRECTION

This report supersedes all previous analyses. The initial implementation contained fundamental architectural errors that were identified and corrected:

**‚ùå Previous Issues:**
- Misunderstood dual portfolio architecture  
- Wrong satellite pool percentage (30% instead of 10%)
- BTC allocation showing impossible 2.9% despite 60-85% rebalancing targets
- Incorrect portfolio separation logic

**‚úÖ Corrected Implementation:**
- **Core Portfolio (90%)**: Monthly rebalancing with 60-85% BTC targets
- **Satellite Portfolio (10%)**: Daily DCA trades based on Fear & Greed
- Proper BTC allocation: **70.4%** (realistic and within target range)

### Executive Summary

This **CORRECTED** comprehensive analysis compares **three distinct Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) strategies** over a 3-year period from July 28, 2022, to July 27, 2025, using complete historical Bitcoin/EUR data and Fear & Greed Index sentiment data.

**üèÜ Winner: Simple DCA (Weekly) - ‚Ç¨29,356 total return (187.0%)**

### Strategy Implementations

#### 1. Simple DCA (Weekly) - Baseline Strategy
- **Logic**: Buy ‚Ç¨100 worth of BTC every Sunday
- **Complexity**: Minimal - single action per week  
- **Allocation**: 100% BTC, 0% EUR (never sells)

#### 2. Logical DCA (Daily Only) - Partial n8n Implementation  
- **Logic**: Daily Fear & Greed-based trading using 30% satellite pool
